DEVELOPMENT PHASES
• Planning: Defining project goals, objectives, and requirements
• Design: Creating a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, 
JavaScript and React.
• Implementation: Writing the analysis code in Python, utilizing 
libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 
• Backend Development: Building the server-side logic with 
Flask for a seamless user experience.
• Testing: Rigorous quality assurance, including unit and 
integration testing.


TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED
• Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React for an intuitive 
user interface.
• Analysis Code: Python, along with Numpy, Pandas, and
Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.
• Prediction: We employed various tools and technologies, 
including Python's Scikit-Learn library for machine learning, 
ensemble techniques, and predictive modeling.
• Backend: Flask, providing a robust foundation for server-side functionality

CHALLENGES FACED
Overcoming data collection and preprocessing challenges, we 
developed custom algorithms to ensure data quality. The Flask 
backend implementation presented complexities that required 
systematic problem-solving.
